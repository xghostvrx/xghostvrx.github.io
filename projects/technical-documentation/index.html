                        Python is a versatile and beginner-friendly programming language
                        that has gained immense popularity for its simplicity and readability. Created in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum, Python emphasizes code
                        readability and simplicity, making it an excellent choice for beginners and experienced programmers alike. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.

                    <p>
                        Python's extensive standard library provides support for many common tasks and allows developers to create complex applications with minimal code. Its readability and simplicity make Python a popular choice for web development, scientific computing, artificial intelligence, data analysis, and automation.

                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Python's readability and simplicity stem from its use of indentation to define code blocks, rather than relying on curly braces or keywords. This approach reduces the likelihood of syntax errors and makes the code more understandable.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                            <p>
                                The extensive standard library of Python includes modules for tasks such as working with files, networking, and even graphical user interfaces, which significantly speeds up development time and reduces the need to reinvent the wheel.

                    <p>
                        In Python, variables are used to store data values. Unlike some other programming languages, Python does not require explicit declaration of variables. You can simply assign a value to a variable, and Python will automatically determine the variable type based on the value assigned. Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores, but they cannot start with a number. Python is case-sensitive, so variables with different capitalization are considered different variables.
                    </p>
                    <span>Example:</span>
                    <code># Assigning values to variables
                        x = 10
                        name = "Alice"
                        is_valid = True

                        # Printing the values of variables
                        print(x)       # Output: 10
                        print(name)    # Output: Alice
                        print(is_valid)   # Output: True
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        Variables can also be reassigned to different values and types:
                    </p>
                    <code>x = 10
                        print(x)       # Output: 10

                        x = "Hello"
                        print(x)       # Output: Hello
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        Python also allows multiple assignments in a single line:
                    </p>
                    <code>a, b, c = 1, 2, 3
                        print(a, b, c)   # Output: 1 2 3
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        Python also supports dynamic typing, meaning you can change the type of a variable based on the value assigned to it:
                    </p>
                    <code>x = 10
                        print(x)       # Output: 10

                        x = "Hello"
                        print(x)       # Output: Hello
                    </code>
